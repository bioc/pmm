Description: The Parallel Mixed Model (PMM) approach is suitable for
        hit selection and cross-comparison of RNAi screens generated in
        experiments that are performed in parallel under several
        conditions. For example, we could think of the measurements or
        readouts from cells under RNAi knock-down, which are infected
        with several pathogens or which are grown from different cell
        lines.
